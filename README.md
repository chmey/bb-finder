# Basic Block Finder

Built on top of the capstone disassembly library, this Python3 program finds basic blocks in binary executables.

Feel free to use the software as you want under the **MIT** license. Just make sure [Capstone](https://pypi.org/project/capstone/) is installed.

By default the program parses a x86 16-bit binary. However this setting can be changed by altering the paramters to the Capstone instantiation.

For code documentation please refer to the inline comments and the docstrings. I have tried to make it very transparent for the readers.
